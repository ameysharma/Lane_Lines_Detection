Lane Finding Pipeline

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
        Does the pipeline for line identification take road images from a video as input and return an annotated video stream as output?


                                    The output video is an annotated version of the input video.

Has a pipeline been implemented that uses the helper functions and / or other code to roughly identify the left and right lane lines with either line segments or solid lines? (example solution included in the repository output: raw-lines-example.mp4)

        In a rough sense, the left and right lane lines are accurately annotated throughout almost all of the video. Annotations can be segmented or solid lines

Have detected line segments been filtered / averaged / extrapolated to map out the full extent of the left and right lane boundaries? (example solution included in the repository: P1_example.mp4)

        Visually, the left and right lane lines are accurately annotated by solid lines throughout most of the video.

Reflection

CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
    Has a thoughtful reflection on the project been provided in the notebook?

        Reflection describes the current pipeline, identifies its potential shortcomings and suggests possible improvements. There is no minimum length. Writing in English is preferred but you may use any language.
